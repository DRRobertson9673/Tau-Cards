# Kill Team Dashboard

## Description
The aim of this project was to build an application to help me keep track of my operatives when playing the game Kill Team.

You can click on an operatives health number to reduce it by one - when it goes below half health the operative border turns grey to show it is injured and is taken off the board when they reach 0 health. Press the operative image to reset.

You can click on a card below the health area to open a full reference card for the operative - from here you can 'activate' the oeperative. Operative cards are darkened if they have been activated this turning point.

You can add equipment to an operative by clicking the arrow at the bottom of their card.

Click on the three dots at the bottom of the page to bring up a dashboard for keeping scores and referencing tactical ploys and other information. From here you can also progress the turning point reactivating all operatives.
